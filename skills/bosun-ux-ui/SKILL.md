# UX/UI Skill

## Overview

Good UX is invisible. Users should accomplish their goals without thinking about the interface. This skill guides systematic review of UI implementations for accessibility, usability, and consistency.

**Core principle:** Accessibility is not optional. WCAG compliance is a legal requirement in many jurisdictions and benefits all users—not just those with disabilities.

## When to Use

Use this skill when you're about to:
- Review UI implementations
- Implement accessibility (WCAG)
- Create design system components
- Evaluate usability
- Build responsive designs

**Use this ESPECIALLY when:**
- No alt text on images
- Color is the only way to convey information
- Interactive elements aren't keyboard accessible
- Form inputs lack labels
- Focus states are missing or hidden

## The UX/UI Review Process

### Phase 1: Check Accessibility First

**Accessibility is the foundation. Start here:**

1. **Perceivable**
   - Can screen readers access all content?
   - Is there sufficient color contrast?
   - Are images described?

2. **Operable**
   - Can everything be done with keyboard?
   - Are focus states visible?
   - Is there enough time for interactions?

3. **Understandable**
   - Is language clear?
   - Are errors explained?
   - Is behavior predictable?

4. **Robust**
   - Is HTML valid and semantic?
   - Are ARIA attributes correct?
   - Does it work across browsers?

### Phase 2: Check Usability

**Then verify usability heuristics:**

1. **System Status**
   - Does the user know what's happening?
   - Are loading states shown?
   - Is progress indicated?

2. **Error Prevention**
   - Are dangerous actions confirmed?
   - Is input validated early?
   - Can mistakes be undone?

3. **Efficiency**
   - Can experts use shortcuts?
   - Is the most common path optimized?
   - Is navigation consistent?

### Phase 3: Check Consistency

**Finally, verify design system adherence:**

1. **Visual Consistency**
   - Following spacing system?
   - Using design tokens?
   - Matching typography scale?

2. **Behavioral Consistency**
   - Same interactions behave same way?
   - Consistent feedback patterns?
   - Predictable navigation?

## Red Flags - STOP and Fix

### Accessibility Red Flags

```html
<!-- ❌ CRITICAL: No alt text -->
<img src="chart.png">

<!-- ❌ CRITICAL: Non-semantic button -->
<div onclick="submit()">Submit</div>

<!-- ❌ HIGH: Color-only information -->
<span style="color: red">Required</span>

<!-- ❌ HIGH: No form label -->
<input type="email" placeholder="Email">

<!-- ❌ HIGH: Hidden focus state -->
*:focus { outline: none; }

<!-- ❌ MEDIUM: Auto-playing media -->
<video autoplay>
```

### Usability Red Flags

```html
<!-- ❌ HIGH: No loading state -->
<button onclick="slowAction()">Save</button>
<!-- User has no idea if click worked -->

<!-- ❌ HIGH: No error explanation -->
<input class="error">  <!-- Why is it error? -->

<!-- ❌ HIGH: Destructive action without confirm -->
<button onclick="deleteAll()">Delete All</button>

<!-- ❌ MEDIUM: Tiny touch target -->
<a style="font-size: 10px;">Click me</a>
```

### Design Consistency Red Flags

```css
/* ❌ HIGH: Hardcoded values */
padding: 13px;  /* Should use spacing token */
font-size: 15px;  /* Should use type scale */
color: #337ab7;  /* Should use color token */

/* ❌ MEDIUM: Inconsistent spacing */
.card { padding: 16px; }
.card-similar { padding: 20px; }  /* Why different? */
```

## Common Rationalizations - Don't Accept These

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Accessibility is for blind people" | It benefits everyone: SEO, mobile, aging users. |
| "We'll add a11y later" | Retrofitting is 10x harder. Build it in. |
| "No one uses keyboard" | Many do. And it's legally required. |
| "The design doesn't have alt text" | Write it yourself. You understand the content. |
| "Our users don't have disabilities" | You don't know that. And they might in the future. |
| "Focus outlines are ugly" | Design better ones. Don't remove them. |

## UX/UI Quality Checklist

Before approving UI changes:

**Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA):**
- [ ] All images have alt text
- [ ] Color contrast meets 4.5:1 (text), 3:1 (large/UI)
- [ ] All interactive elements keyboard accessible
- [ ] Form inputs have associated labels
- [ ] Focus states visible and meaningful
- [ ] Heading hierarchy is logical (h1 → h2 → h3)
- [ ] ARIA used correctly (or not at all)

**Usability:**
- [ ] Loading states shown for async operations
- [ ] Error messages explain how to fix
- [ ] Destructive actions require confirmation
- [ ] Touch targets are 44x44px minimum
- [ ] Most common paths are optimized

**Consistency:**
- [ ] Uses design system tokens
- [ ] Follows established patterns
- [ ] Spacing/typography from scale

## Quick Patterns

### Accessible Button

```html
<!-- ✅ Semantic, keyboard accessible, described -->
<button
  type="submit"
  aria-label="Submit contact form"
  disabled={isSubmitting}
>
  {isSubmitting ? 'Submitting...' : 'Submit'}
</button>
```

### Accessible Form Field

```html
<!-- ✅ Labeled, described, with error handling -->
<div class="field">
  <label for="email">
    Email address
    <span aria-hidden="true">*</span>
  </label>
  <input
    type="email"
    id="email"
    required
    aria-required="true"
    aria-describedby="email-hint email-error"
    aria-invalid={hasError}
  >
  <span id="email-hint" class="hint">
    We'll never share your email.
  </span>
  {hasError && (
    <span id="email-error" class="error" role="alert">
      Please enter a valid email address.
    </span>
  )}
</div>
```

### Accessible Image

```html
<!-- ✅ Informative image with description -->
<img
  src="sales-chart.png"
  alt="Sales chart showing 25% growth in Q4 2024"
>

<!-- ✅ Decorative image (skip for screen readers) -->
<img src="decorative-line.png" alt="" role="presentation">
```

### Skip Link

```html
<!-- ✅ Skip to main content for keyboard users -->
<a href="#main" class="skip-link">
  Skip to main content
</a>

<style>
.skip-link {
  position: absolute;
  top: -40px;
  left: 0;
  padding: 8px;
  background: #000;
  color: #fff;
  z-index: 100;
}
.skip-link:focus {
  top: 0;
}
</style>
```

### Focus Styles

```css
/* ✅ Visible, high-contrast focus indicator */
:focus {
  outline: 2px solid #005fcc;
  outline-offset: 2px;
}

/* ✅ Only hide for mouse users */
:focus:not(:focus-visible) {
  outline: none;
}
:focus-visible {
  outline: 2px solid #005fcc;
  outline-offset: 2px;
}
```

```

## WCAG Quick Reference

| Level | Requirement | Ratio |

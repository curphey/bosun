# bosun-threat-model Research

Research document for the threat modeling skill.

## Phase 1: Upstream Survey

### 1. obra/superpowers Analysis

After analyzing the [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) repository, **no dedicated threat modeling or security analysis skills were found**. The framework focuses primarily on development workflow skills including:

- Code review processes with issue severity assessment
- Test-driven development (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR methodology)
- Systematic debugging with 4-phase root cause analysis
- Design, planning, execution, and collaboration workflows

The repository has a Security tab but no specific threat modeling capabilities are documented as part of the skills library.

### 2. VoltAgent/awesome-claude-code-subagents Analysis

The [VoltAgent/awesome-claude-code-subagents](https://github.com/VoltAgent/awesome-claude-code-subagents) repository contains several security-focused subagents under the "Quality & Security" category (plugin: `voltagent-qa-sec`):

| Subagent | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **security-auditor** | Security vulnerability expert |
| **penetration-tester** | Ethical hacking specialist |
| **security-engineer** | Infrastructure security specialist |
| **compliance-auditor** | Regulatory compliance expert |
| **ad-security-reviewer** | Active Directory security and GPO audit specialist |
| **powershell-security-hardening** | PowerShell security hardening and compliance specialist |

Related agents include `code-reviewer`, `architect-reviewer`, and `chaos-engineer`. However, **no dedicated threat modeling subagent exists**.

### 3. Other Claude Code Security Plugins

Several relevant tools and plugins exist in the ecosystem:

| Tool | Description | Source |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **anthropics/claude-code-security-review** | Official AI-powered security review GitHub Action using Claude | [GitHub](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-security-review) |
| **nelson-muntz** | Claude Code plugin that "thinks like an attacker" with iterative attack loops | [GitHub](https://github.com/zkarimi22/nelson-muntz) |
| **SecureVibes** | Python-based scanner using five specialized AI agents for code security | [CyberPress](https://cyberpress.org/securevibes-new-ai-vulnerabilities/) |
| **Semgrep + Claude** | Integration for finding vulnerabilities in web apps | [Semgrep Blog](https://semgrep.dev/blog/2025/finding-vulnerabilities-in-modern-web-apps-using-claude-code-and-openai-codex/) |

### 4. Upstream Summary

**Gap Identified**: No comprehensive threat modeling skill exists in the Claude Code ecosystem. Existing tools focus on:
- Static vulnerability scanning
- Code review for security issues
- Penetration testing guidance
- Compliance auditing

A dedicated threat modeling skill would fill a significant gap by providing systematic threat identification and risk assessment capabilities.

- [STRIDE Model - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STRIDE_model)
- [Security Compass - STRIDE](https://www.securitycompass.com/blog/stride-in-threat-modeling/)

#### Overview

STRIDE is a threat modeling framework developed by Microsoft in the late 1990s by Praerit Garg and Loren Kohnfelder. It categorizes threats into six types, each corresponding to a core security principle:

| Threat Category | Security Property Violated | Description |
|----------------|---------------------------|-------------|
| **S**poofing | Authenticity | Pretending to be something or someone else (DNS spoofing, ARP spoofing, IP spoofing) |
| **T**ampering | Integrity | Malicious modification of data or systems |
| **R**epudiation | Non-repudiability | Denying having performed an action |
| **I**nformation Disclosure | Confidentiality | Unauthorized access to sensitive data |
| **D**enial of Service | Availability | Making systems unavailable |
| **E**levation of Privilege | Authorization | Gaining unauthorized access levels |

#### STRIDE Template

```markdown
## STRIDE Analysis for [Component Name]

### Component Description
[Brief description of the component being analyzed]

### Threat Analysis

#### Spoofing
- [ ] Can an attacker impersonate a legitimate user?
- [ ] Are authentication mechanisms properly implemented?
- [ ] Is there protection against session hijacking?

#### Tampering
- [ ] Can data be modified in transit?
- [ ] Can stored data be altered without detection?
- [ ] Are integrity checks in place?

#### Repudiation
- [ ] Are all security-relevant actions logged?
- [ ] Can users deny performing actions?
- [ ] Is there adequate audit trail?

#### Information Disclosure
- [ ] Is sensitive data encrypted at rest?
- [ ] Is sensitive data encrypted in transit?
- [ ] Are error messages leaking information?

#### Denial of Service
- [ ] Is there rate limiting?
- [ ] Are resources bounded?
- [ ] Is there protection against resource exhaustion?

#### Elevation of Privilege
- [ ] Is principle of least privilege followed?
- [ ] Are authorization checks performed at every level?
- [ ] Is input validation preventing injection attacks?
```

#### Best Practices for Developers

1. **Apply Early**: Perform STRIDE analysis during design phase before code is written
2. **Iterate Continuously**: Re-assess when migrating to multi-cloud, refactoring core components, or adjusting IAM policies
3. **Map to Trust Boundaries**: Apply STRIDE per element at trust boundary crossings
4. **Combine with DREAD**: Use DREAD scoring to prioritize identified STRIDE threats
5. **Document Mitigations**: For each threat, document specific countermeasures

- [Create Threat Model Using DFD Elements](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/tm-create-a-threat-model-using-foundational-data-flow-diagram-elements/)

#### Core Approach

Microsoft's threat modeling methodology consists of four main phases:

1. **Create an Application Diagram** - Model the system using Data Flow Diagrams
2. **Identify Threats** - Use STRIDE-per-element analysis
3. **Mitigate Threats** - Develop and implement countermeasures
4. **Validate Mitigations** - Verify threats have been addressed

#### Key Features of Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Design View** | Create data flow diagrams of the project |
| **Analysis View** | Generate STRIDE-based threat lists automatically |
| **Trust Boundaries** | Red dotted lines showing where trust levels change |
| **Template System** | Pre-built templates for common scenarios |
| **Threat Generation** | Automated threat suggestions based on diagram elements |
| **Reporting** | Security activity and testing verification reports |

#### Design Philosophy

- **Software-Centered**: Builds on activities developers are familiar with (drawing architecture diagrams)
- **Non-Security Expert Friendly**: Designed to be accessible to all developers
- **Layered Diagrams**: Recommends diagrams be layered to preserve relevance without overwhelming detail
- **Standard Notation**: Uses consistent notation for system components, data flows, and security boundaries

#### Microsoft SDL Integration

- [Practical DevSecOps - Attack Trees Guide](https://www.practical-devsecops.com/threat-modeling-using-attack-trees/)
- [Attack Trees Threat Modeling](https://threat-modeling.com/attack-trees-threat-modeling/)

#### Overview

Attack trees provide a formal, methodical way of describing security of systems based on varying attacks. The goal is represented as the root node, with different ways of achieving that goal as leaf nodes.

#### Structure

```
                    [Root: Attacker Goal]
                           |
              -------------------------
              |                       |
         [OR: Method 1]          [OR: Method 2]
              |                       |
        -------------           -------------
        |           |           |           |
   [AND: Step A] [AND: Step B]  [Leaf]    [Leaf]
```

**Node Types:**
- **OR Nodes**: Alternative methods (attacker needs only ONE to succeed)
- **AND Nodes**: Sequential steps (attacker needs ALL to succeed)

#### Attack Tree Example Template

```markdown
## Attack Tree: [Goal Name]

### Root Goal
[Describe the attacker's ultimate objective]

### Level 1 - Primary Attack Vectors (OR)
1. **Vector A**: [Description]
2. **Vector B**: [Description]
3. **Vector C**: [Description]

### Level 2 - Sub-goals for Vector A (AND/OR)
1.1. [Sub-step required] (AND)
1.2. [Alternative approach] (OR)

### Risk Assessment
| Node | Likelihood | Impact | Difficulty | Cost |
|------|------------|--------|------------|------|
| 1.1  | High       | Critical| Low       | $    |
| 1.2  | Medium     | High   | Medium     | $$   |

### Recommended Mitigations
- [Mitigation for highest-risk paths]
```

#### Benefits

- **Structure**: Repeatable, logical breakdown of threats
- **Clarity**: Complex threats visualized for technical and non-technical audiences
- **Prioritization**: Assign values (cost, likelihood, complexity) for effective mitigation prioritization
- **Reusability**: Capture and reuse expertise about security

#### Integration with Other Methodologies

Attack trees integrate with:
- **STRIDE**: Threats become root nodes
- **MITRE ATT&CK**: Operational threat modeling
- **PASTA**: Created during Stage 4 (Threat Analysis)
- **Trike**: Discovered threats become attack tree root nodes

### 4. Data Flow Diagrams for Security Analysis

**Sources:**
- [Practical DevSecOps - Threat Modeling DFDs](https://www.practical-devsecops.com/threat-modeling-data-flow-diagrams/)

- [OWASP - Threat Modeling Process](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process)

#### DFD Components

| Component | Symbol | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **Process** | Circle/Rounded Rectangle | Applications that apply logic and/or change data |
| **Data Store** | Two parallel lines or Cylinder | Storage locations (databases, files) |
| **External Entity/Interactor** | Rectangle | Endpoints (users, external systems) outside system scope |
| **Data Flow** | Arrow | Movement of data between components |
| **Trust Boundary** | Dotted Line/Rectangle | Boundary between different trust zones |

#### Trust Boundaries

Trust boundaries are critical for security analysis because:
- Calls crossing them often need authentication and authorization
- Data crossing may need to be treated as untrusted and validated
- Business/regulatory rules may restrict data flow (HIPAA, data sovereignty)
- They indicate attack surfaces where attackers can interject

**Types of Trust Boundaries:**
- Machine boundaries
- Privilege boundaries
- Integrity boundaries
- Network boundaries (internal/external)

#### DFD Template for Security Analysis

```markdown
## Data Flow Diagram: [System Name]

### System Boundaries
- **In Scope**: [Components within analysis boundary]
- **Out of Scope**: [External dependencies not analyzed]

### External Entities
| ID | Entity | Description | Trust Level |
|----|--------|-------------|-------------|
| E1 | User   | End user    | Untrusted   |
| E2 | Admin  | Administrator| Trusted    |

### Processes
| ID | Process | Description | Trust Zone |
|----|---------|-------------|------------|
| P1 | Web App | Frontend    | DMZ        |
| P2 | API     | Backend     | Internal   |

### Data Stores
| ID | Store | Data Type | Sensitivity |
|----|-------|-----------|-------------|
| D1 | UserDB| PII       | High        |
| D2 | Logs  | Audit     | Medium      |

### Data Flows
| ID | From | To | Data | Crosses Trust Boundary? |
|----|------|-----|------|------------------------|
| F1 | E1   | P1  | Credentials | Yes (Internet to DMZ) |
| F2 | P1   | P2  | API Requests| Yes (DMZ to Internal) |

### Trust Boundaries Identified
1. **TB1**: Internet / DMZ boundary
2. **TB2**: DMZ / Internal Network boundary
3. **TB3**: Application / Database boundary
```

#### Best Practices

1. **Define System Boundaries**: Clearly outline what's in and out of scope
2. **Identify All Data Flows**: Visualize where data enters, moves, and lands
3. **Mark Trust Boundaries**: Show where trust levels change
4. **Think Like an Attacker**: Consider threats at each stage
5. **Keep It Simple**: Use limited symbols for broad understanding
6. **Layer Appropriately**: Don't go overboard on detail but provide relevant context

### 6. Security User Stories and Abuse Cases

**Sources:**
- [OWASP Abuse Case Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Abuse_Case_Cheat_Sheet.html)
- [DZone - Adding AppSec to Agile](https://dzone.com/articles/adding-appsec-agile-security)

- [we45 - Abuser Stories for Scrum Teams](https://www.we45.com/post/abuser-stories-a-sneak-peak-for-scrum-teams)

#### Concepts

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Abuse Case** | Describes how attackers misuse or exploit weaknesses in controls |
| **Abuser Story** | User story from the perspective of a malicious adversary |
| **Evil User Story** | Negative cases the team needs to consider during implementation |
| **Misuse Case** | How users misuse software features to attack an application |

#### Abuser Story Template

```markdown
## Abuser Story: [Threat Name]

**As a** [malicious actor type],
**I want to** [malicious action],
**So that** [attacker's goal/benefit].

### Example Stories

**As a** malicious user,
**I want to** send SQL injection in form fields,
**So that** I can access unauthorized data.

**As a** hacker,
**I want to** enumerate valid usernames via login error messages,
**So that** I can perform targeted credential attacks.

**As a** disgruntled employee,
**I want to** access another user's account data,
**So that** I can steal or modify their information.
```

#### Evil User Story Examples

From Johan Peeters (2008) and subsequent adaptations:

1. "As a hacker, I can send bad data in URLs, so I can access data and functions for which I'm not authorized."
2. "As a hacker, I can send bad data in the content of requests, so I can access data and functions for which I'm not authorized."
3. "As a hacker, I can intercept network traffic so I can steal credentials and session tokens."
4. "As a hacker, I can exploit weak session management so I can hijack user sessions."

#### Security Story Integration in Agile

```markdown
## User Story with Security Acceptance Criteria

**Title**: User Login

**As a** registered user,
**I want to** log into my account,
**So that** I can access my personal dashboard.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Login form accepts email and password
- [ ] Successful login redirects to dashboard
- [ ] Invalid credentials show generic error message

### Security Acceptance Criteria (derived from Abuser Stories)
- [ ] Failed login attempts are rate-limited (max 5/minute)
- [ ] Account lockout after 10 failed attempts
- [ ] Passwords are transmitted over HTTPS only
- [ ] Session tokens use secure, HttpOnly cookies
- [ ] Error messages do not reveal if email exists
- [ ] All login attempts are logged with timestamp and IP
```

#### Best Practices

1. **Workshop Integration**: Create abuser stories after sprint planning when user stories are defined
2. **Security Champion**: Have security-aware team member guide initial sessions
3. **Backlog Management**: Add security stories to product backlog for prioritization
4. **Definition of Done**: Include security acceptance criteria in DoD
5. **Automated Testing**: Convert abuser stories into security test cases

- [InfoSecurity Europe - Beyond CVSS](https://www.infosecurityeurope.com/en-gb/blog/future-thinking/new-frameworks-vulnerability-risk-assessment.html)

#### DREAD Framework

DREAD was introduced by Microsoft in 2002 for threat prioritization:

| Factor | Description | Scoring (1-3) |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| **D**amage | How bad is the impact? | 1=Low, 2=Medium, 3=High |
| **R**eproducibility | How easy to reproduce? | 1=Hard, 2=Sometimes, 3=Always |
| **E**xploitability | How easy to execute? | 1=Hard, 2=Medium, 3=Easy |
| **A**ffected Users | How many users impacted? | 1=Few, 2=Some, 3=All |
| **D**iscoverability | How easy to find? | 1=Hard, 2=Medium, 3=Easy |

**DREAD Score Calculation:**
```
Risk Score = (D + R + E + A + D) / 5
```

**Risk Levels:**
- **High Risk**: 2.5 - 3.0
- **Medium Risk**: 1.5 - 2.4
- **Low Risk**: 1.0 - 1.4

#### DREAD Template

```markdown
## DREAD Assessment: [Vulnerability Name]

### Threat Description
[Describe the threat/vulnerability]

### DREAD Scoring

| Factor | Score | Justification |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| Damage | [1-3] | [Explanation] |
| Reproducibility | [1-3] | [Explanation] |
| Exploitability | [1-3] | [Explanation] |
| Affected Users | [1-3] | [Explanation] |
| Discoverability | [1-3] | [Explanation] |

**Total Score**: [X.X] / 3.0
**Risk Level**: [High/Medium/Low]

### Recommended Priority
[Based on score, recommend mitigation timeline]
```

#### CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)

CVSS 4.0 (released July 2023) uses three metric groups:

**Base Metrics (6 factors):**
- Attack Vector (AV)
- Attack Complexity (AC)
- Attack Requirements (AR)
- Privileges Required (PR)
- User Interaction (UI)
- Vulnerable System Impact (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)

**Temporal Metrics (3 factors):**
- Exploit Code Maturity
- Remediation Level
- Report Confidence

**Environmental Metrics (5 factors):**
- Modified Base Metrics
- Confidentiality/Integrity/Availability Requirements

**CVSS Score Ranges:**
| Score | Severity |
|-------|----------|
| 0.0 | None |
| 0.1 - 3.9 | Low |
| 4.0 - 6.9 | Medium |
| 7.0 - 8.9 | High |
| 9.0 - 10.0 | Critical |

#### Comparison: CVSS vs DREAD

| Aspect | CVSS | DREAD |
|--------|------|-------|
| **Complexity** | High (14 metric groups) | Simple (5 factors) |
| **Standardization** | Industry standard | Qualitative, organization-specific |
| **Best For** | Technical vulnerability assessment | Quick risk triage |
| **Audience** | Security engineers | Mixed technical/business |
| **Maintenance** | Static (requires reassessment) | Flexible, contextual |

#### Hybrid Approach

Many organizations use both:
1. **CVSS** for technical severity baseline
2. **DREAD** for contextual business risk assessment
3. **Risk Matrix** combining both scores for final prioritization

| 2 | Define Technical Scope | Identify what we're protecting |
| 3 | Application Decomposition | Break down application architecture |
| 4 | Threat Analysis | Create attack trees, identify threats |
| 5 | Vulnerability Analysis | Identify weaknesses supporting threat assertions |
| 6 | Attack Modeling | Simulate attacks on identified weaknesses |
| 7 | Risk & Impact Analysis | Define countermeasures, reduce risk |

**Key Benefits:**
- Scalable for growing businesses
- Cross-team collaboration
- Attacker-focused perspective
- Compatible with Agile/DevOps workflows

#### LINDDUN (Privacy Threat Modeling)

|--------|-------------|
| **L**inking | Combining data to learn more about individuals |
| **I**dentifying | Learning identity through data |
| **N**on-repudiation | Inability to deny actions (privacy violation) |
| **D**etecting | Distinguishing if item of interest exists |
| **D**ata Disclosure | Exposure of personal data |
| **U**nawareness | Insufficient privacy impact feedback |
| **N**on-compliance | Not following privacy best practices |

**Three Implementation Methods:**
- **LINDDUN Go**: Lean, game-based team approach
- **LINDDUN Pro**: Systematic with DFD usage
- **LINDDUN Maestro**: Exhaustive threat-specific analysis

# SEO/LLM Skill

## Overview

Search engines and LLMs are your content's primary distributors. This skill guides systematic optimization of content for both traditional search and AI understanding.

**Core principle:** Write for humans first, structure for machines second. If content isn't useful to humans, no amount of optimization helps. But structure helps machines surface good content.

## When to Use

Use this skill when you're about to:
- Optimize web content for search engines
- Implement structured data (Schema.org)
- Make content LLM-friendly
- Improve meta tags and descriptions
- Set up sitemaps and robots.txt

**Use this ESPECIALLY when:**
- Pages lack meta descriptions
- No structured data is present
- Content is hard to extract programmatically
- Headings don't form a logical hierarchy
- Important content is hidden in JavaScript

## The SEO/LLM Optimization Process

### Phase 1: Check Technical Foundation

**Technical SEO must work first:**

1. **Crawlability**
   - Can search engines access the content?
   - Is robots.txt configured correctly?
   - Are important pages in sitemap?

2. **Indexability**
   - Are pages being indexed?
   - Any noindex tags unintentionally?
   - Canonical URLs correct?

3. **Performance**
   - Core Web Vitals passing?
   - Mobile-friendly?
   - Fast enough for users?

### Phase 2: Check Content Structure

**Then verify content is understandable:**

1. **Semantic HTML**
   - One h1 per page?
   - Logical heading hierarchy?
   - Meaningful markup?

2. **Structured Data**
   - Schema.org for content type?
   - Valid JSON-LD?
   - Testing in Rich Results?

3. **Meta Content**
   - Unique, descriptive titles?
   - Compelling meta descriptions?
   - Open Graph for social?

### Phase 3: Check LLM Readability

**Finally, optimize for AI extraction:**

1. **Clear Structure**
   - Summary at the start?
   - One idea per paragraph?
   - Lists and tables for data?

2. **Explicit Definitions**
   - Terms defined on first use?
   - Context provided?
   - No assumed knowledge?

3. **Extractable Content**
   - Key facts easily identified?
   - FAQs in proper format?
   - No important content in images?

## Red Flags - STOP and Fix

### Technical SEO Red Flags

```html
<!-- ❌ CRITICAL: Blocking search engines -->
<meta name="robots" content="noindex">  <!-- Intentional? -->

<!-- ❌ CRITICAL: Missing canonical -->
<!-- No canonical = duplicate content -->

<!-- ❌ HIGH: No lang attribute -->
<html>  <!-- Should be <html lang="en"> -->

<!-- ❌ HIGH: Missing viewport -->
<!-- Not mobile-friendly -->

<!-- ❌ MEDIUM: HTTP not HTTPS -->
<!-- Modern SEO requires HTTPS -->
```

### Content Structure Red Flags

```html
<!-- ❌ HIGH: Multiple h1 tags -->
<h1>Main Title</h1>
...
<h1>Another Title</h1>  <!-- Should be h2 -->

<!-- ❌ HIGH: Skipped heading levels -->
<h1>Title</h1>
<h3>Subtitle</h3>  <!-- Skipped h2! -->

<!-- ❌ HIGH: Missing meta description -->
<!-- No description = Google writes one -->

<!-- ❌ MEDIUM: Generic title -->
<title>Home</title>  <!-- Should describe content -->
```

### LLM Readability Red Flags

```markdown
<!-- ❌ HIGH: Wall of text -->
[2000 words with no headings, lists, or structure]

<!-- ❌ HIGH: Content in images -->
<img src="pricing-table.png">  <!-- Text should be HTML -->

<!-- ❌ HIGH: No summary -->
[Long article with no intro or TL;DR]

<!-- ❌ MEDIUM: Undefined jargon -->
"Enable HMR for better DX"  <!-- Define acronyms! -->
```

## Common Rationalizations - Don't Accept These

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "SEO is manipulative" | Good SEO is good UX. Help users find content. |
| "Schema is too complex" | JSON-LD is simple. Use generators if needed. |
| "Meta descriptions are ignored" | They appear in search results. Write them. |
| "LLMs don't matter" | AI search is growing fast. Optimize now. |
| "Our content is niche" | Niche content needs SEO more, not less. |
| "We'll add structure later" | Structure aids writing. Do it first. |

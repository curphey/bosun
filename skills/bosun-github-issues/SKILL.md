# GitHub Issues Management

## Overview

Good issues drive good software. Bad issues waste everyone's time. This skill guides systematic improvement of GitHub issue management - from individual issue quality to repository-wide workflows.

**Core principle:** Every issue should be actionable. If someone can't start working from the issue alone, it's not ready.

## When to Use

Use this skill when you're about to:
- Audit issue quality in a repository
- Create or improve issue templates
- Add acceptance criteria to issues
- Set up labels and workflows
- Review stale or abandoned issues
- Coach a team on issue best practices

## The Issue Management Process

### Phase 1: Issue Quality Audit

Assess current state of issues:

1. **Title Quality**
   - Is it specific and actionable?
   - Does it describe the outcome, not just the task?
   - Can someone understand it without reading the body?

2. **Description Completeness**
   - Sufficient context provided?
   - Steps to reproduce (for bugs)?
   - User story format (for features)?

3. **Acceptance Criteria**
   - Clear definition of "done"?
   - Testable conditions?
   - Checkbox format for tracking?

4. **Metadata**
   - Appropriate labels?
   - Assigned to someone?
   - Milestone set?
   - Related issues linked?

### Phase 2: Template Implementation

Create templates in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`:

1. **Bug Report** (`bug_report.md`)
   - Description, steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Environment details
   - Acceptance criteria

2. **Feature Request** (`feature_request.md`)
   - User story format
   - Detailed description
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Additional context

3. **Documentation** (`documentation.md`)
   - What needs documenting
   - Target audience
   - Acceptance criteria

4. **Config File** (`config.yml`)
   - Blank issue prevention
   - External links (discussions, security)

### Phase 3: Workflow Setup

Implement issue lifecycle management:

1. **Labels**
   - Type: bug, enhancement, documentation
   - Priority: priority-1, priority-2, priority-3
   - Status: needs-triage, in-progress, blocked
   - Effort: good-first-issue, help-wanted

2. **Automation**
   - Auto-label based on content
   - Stale issue management
   - Required fields validation
   - Project board integration

## Red Flags - STOP and Fix

### Issue Title Red Flags
```
❌ "Bug fix"                    → "Fix login timeout on slow connections"
❌ "Update"                     → "Update API docs with auth examples"
❌ "Feature"                    → "Add dark mode toggle to settings"
❌ "Problem with X"             → "X crashes when input exceeds 1MB"
❌ "Doesn't work"               → "Payment form rejects valid credit cards"
```

### Issue Body Red Flags
```
❌ Empty or minimal description
❌ No steps to reproduce for bugs
❌ No acceptance criteria
❌ Screenshots of text (use code blocks)
❌ "See Slack conversation" (context should be in issue)
❌ Multiple unrelated problems in one issue
```

### Repository Red Flags
```
❌ No issue templates
❌ No labels defined
❌ Many issues without labels
❌ Many issues without assignees
❌ Stale issues (>30 days, no activity)
❌ Duplicate issues not linked/closed
```

## Common Rationalizations - Don't Accept These

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "The title is obvious" | Not to someone new. Be explicit. |
| "We discussed it in Slack" | Slack disappears. Issues persist. |
| "Acceptance criteria slow us down" | Unclear scope slows you down more. |
| "Labels are overhead" | Labels enable filtering and triage. |
| "We'll clean up issues later" | Later never comes. Maintain as you go. |
| "Everyone knows what this means" | New team members don't. Be explicit. |

# GitHub Issues Audit: my-org/my-repo

**Date:** 2026-01-23
**Total Open Issues:** 45

## Summary

| Metric | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| With acceptance criteria | 12 | 27% |
| With labels | 38 | 84% |
| With assignees | 15 | 33% |
| Stale (>30 days) | 18 | 40% |

## Issues Needing Attention

### Missing Acceptance Criteria (33 issues)
- #42: Add user authentication
- #51: Improve performance
- #67: Refactor payment module

### Vague Titles (8 issues)
| Issue | Current | Suggested |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| #23 | "Bug fix" | "Fix login timeout on mobile" |
| #34 | "Update docs" | "Add API auth examples to README" |

### Stale Issues (18 issues)
- #12: Last activity 45 days ago

- Consider: close, reassign, or add update

## Recommendations

1. **Create issue templates** - Add .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/
2. **Add missing labels** - 7 issues unlabeled
3. **Define acceptance criteria format** - Document in CONTRIBUTING.md
4. **Implement stale bot** - Auto-warn after 30 days
```

# Python Skill

## Overview

Python's readability is its strength. This skill guides writing idiomatic Python that's clear, maintainable, and follows community standards.

**Core principle:** Explicit is better than implicit. Readability counts. If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.

## When to Use

Use this skill when you're about to:
- Write new Python code
- Review Python for best practices
- Add type hints to existing code
- Debug Python issues
- Set up Python project tooling

**Use this ESPECIALLY when:**
- Code is "clever" but hard to read
- Type hints are missing or incomplete
- Bare except clauses appear
- Mutable default arguments are used
- Code could be more Pythonic

## The Pythonic Development Process

### Phase 1: Design Pythonically

**Before writing implementation:**

1. **Consider the Zen of Python**
   - Is there one obvious way to do this?
   - Is simple better than complex here?
   - Will this be readable in 6 months?

2. **Design with Types**
   ```python
   def get_user(user_id: str) -> User | None:
       """Fetch user by ID, return None if not found."""
       ...
   ```

3. **Choose the Right Data Structure**
   - List for ordered sequences
   - Set for unique items and fast lookup
   - Dict for key-value mapping
   - Dataclass for structured data

### Phase 2: Implement Idiomatically

**Write Python, not Java-in-Python:**

1. **Use Built-in Features**
   ```python
   # ❌ Non-Pythonic
   result = []
   for item in items:
       if item.active:
           result.append(item.name)

   # ✅ Pythonic
   result = [item.name for item in items if item.active]
   ```

2. **Handle Errors Explicitly**
   ```python
   # ❌ Bare except
   try:
       process(data)
   except:
       pass

   # ✅ Specific exceptions
   try:
       process(data)
   except ValidationError as e:
       logger.warning(f"Invalid data: {e}")
       raise
   ```

3. **Use Context Managers**
   ```python
   # ❌ Manual resource management
   f = open('file.txt')
   content = f.read()
   f.close()

   # ✅ Context manager
   with open('file.txt') as f:
       content = f.read()
   ```

### Phase 3: Review for Quality

**Before approving:**

1. **Check Type Coverage**
   - Are all public functions typed?
   - Run `mypy` with strict mode

2. **Check for Anti-patterns**
   - Mutable default arguments?
   - Bare except clauses?
   - Global state mutation?

3. **Verify Tests**
   - Are edge cases covered?
   - Are exceptions tested?

## Red Flags - STOP and Fix

### Python Anti-patterns

```python
# Mutable default argument (bug!)
def add_item(item, items=[]):  # Same list reused!

# Bare except (hides bugs)
except:
    pass

# Star import (namespace pollution)
from module import *

# Type checking with type()
if type(x) == list:  # Doesn't handle subclasses

# String concatenation in loop
result = ""
for s in strings:
    result += s  # O(n²)
```

### Code Quality Red Flags

```
- Functions > 50 lines (break them up)
- Deeply nested code > 3 levels (simplify)
- Magic numbers without names
- No docstrings on public functions
- Commented-out code (delete it)
- print() for logging (use logging module)
```

### Type Hint Red Flags

```
- Any type used without justification
- Missing return type annotations
- # type: ignore without explanation
- Union of many unrelated types
- No type hints on public API
```

## Common Rationalizations - Don't Accept These

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Duck typing means no type hints" | Type hints document intent and catch bugs. |
| "It's Pythonic to be dynamic" | Explicit is better than implicit. Add types. |
| "Performance doesn't matter" | Algorithmic complexity matters. O(n²) hurts. |
| "Exception handling is verbose" | Specific handling prevents hidden bugs. |
| "It works" | Working isn't enough. It must be readable. |
| "I'll add types later" | Later never comes. Add them now. |

## Python Quality Checklist

Before approving Python code:

- [ ] **Typed**: Public functions have type hints
- [ ] **Mypy clean**: No type errors
- [ ] **No bare except**: All exceptions are specific
- [ ] **No mutable defaults**: Default arguments are immutable
- [ ] **Context managers**: Resources properly managed
- [ ] **Docstrings**: Public API is documented
- [ ] **Tests**: Behavior is tested

## Quick Pythonic Patterns

### Use Dataclasses

```python
# ❌ Manual __init__, __repr__, __eq__
class User:
    def __init__(self, id, name, email):
        self.id = id
        self.name = name
        self.email = email

# ✅ Dataclass
@dataclass
class User:
    id: str
    name: str
    email: str
```

### Use Comprehensions

```python
# ❌ Manual loop
squares = []
for x in range(10):
    squares.append(x ** 2)

# ✅ List comprehension
squares = [x ** 2 for x in range(10)]

# Dict comprehension
user_map = {u.id: u for u in users}

# Generator for large data
total = sum(x ** 2 for x in range(1000000))
```

### Handle Optional Values

```python
# ❌ None checks everywhere
if user is not None:
    if user.profile is not None:
        name = user.profile.name

# ✅ Early return or walrus operator
if user is None or user.profile is None:
    return None
name = user.profile.name

# Or use getattr with default
name = getattr(getattr(user, 'profile', None), 'name', 'Unknown')
```

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Type checking
mypy src/ --strict

# Linting and formatting
ruff check . --fix
ruff format .

# Testing
pytest -v --cov=src

# Security
bandit -r src/
pip-audit
```

# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Bosun is a Claude Code plugin (skills framework) that helps developers throughout the entire development lifecycle—from initial setup to development, code review, and release.

## Current Status

This project is in early development. No skills or commands have been implemented yet.

## Planned Architecture

Bosun will provide skills and commands for:
- Project scaffolding and environment setup
- Development workflow assistance
- Automated code review workflows
- Release preparation and version management

Structure will follow the Claude Code plugin pattern with `skills/`, `commands/`, and `hooks/` directories.
